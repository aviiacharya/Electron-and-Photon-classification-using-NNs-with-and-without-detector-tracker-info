# Electron-and-Photon-classification-using-NNs-with-and-without-detector-tracker-info

This project aims to classify photons and electrons using deep learning models based on data from the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The classification is performed separately for two regions of the detector: the barrel region (EB) and the endcap region (EE). The project involves preprocessing, feature selection, and training deep neural networks to distinguish between photons and electrons using tracking information.

The data used for this project is extracted from ROOT files, which contain information on photons and electrons captured by the ECAL. The files are converted into pandas DataFrames using the `uproot` library. The classification involves photons and electrons with transverse momentum (pT) between 30 and 1800 GeV. Separate data frames are created for photons and electrons, which are further filtered based on specific conditions, such as whether they pass certain identification criteria like high-pT ID and whether they are located in the EB or EE regions.

Two separate neural network models are trained, one for each region of the detector. The first model is trained for the barrel region (EB) using 14 features, including a tracking parameter. The training dataset comprises 1,854,806 total examples, with 1,483,844 used for training and validation and 370,962 for testing. The model architecture consists of eight layers, with the first layer having 300 neurons and the subsequent layers progressively decreasing in size. The model is compiled using the Nadam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function and trained over 50 epochs. The best model is saved using model checkpoints, and early stopping is employed to avoid overfitting. The model achieves a final validation accuracy of approximately 94.71%.

The second model is trained without the tracking information, reducing the input dimensions to 13 features. The model architecture is similar to the first, with eight layers of progressively decreasing neurons. The training follows the same procedure, with 50 epochs, model checkpoints, and early stopping. The model achieves a final validation accuracy of about 77.58%.

Both models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, loss, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Confusion matrices are generated to assess the classification performance of photons and electrons, indicating true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Additionally, the correlation between different features is analyzed using a heatmap to understand the dependencies among the input variables.

The project demonstrates that including tracking information significantly improves the classification performance, as evidenced by the higher accuracy achieved by the model trained with tracking information. The results suggest that leveraging multiple parameters, including tracking data, can enhance the identification of particles in high-energy physics experiments. Future work could involve optimizing the model architecture further or incorporating additional features to improve the classification accuracy further.
